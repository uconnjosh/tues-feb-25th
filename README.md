Work done at Epicodus on Tues, feb 25


The address book folder includes a javascript address book. Although we had done a similar exercise before, this address book
has phone number validations! Entering a phone number that isn't ten digits will yield an alert, asking the user to try again.

This repository also includes a simple 'to-do' list app in the to-do folder.
